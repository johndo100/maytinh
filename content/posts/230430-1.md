Hi!

I'm ussually create my websites with Hugo and put it on the internet by github.

Sometimes I use free hugo theme with no modification, just clone it from github.

It was OK when I work on 1 computer.

When I change to another computer the theme did'nt pull from its branch.

So I need to pull/update it from github.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

My hugo site will work perfectly.
