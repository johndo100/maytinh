I've been around with FreeBSD for a while.

I've ussually install program by pkg. Sometimes I found program I need on freshports but when I search for it on FreeBSD, it was not found.

The problem is FreeBSD default branch is Quarterly not Latest.

So I changed it to Latest.

```
# mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos
# echo 'FreeBSD: { url: "pkg+http://pkg.FreeBSD.org/${ABI}/latest" }' > /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf
# pkg update -f
```

You can found this info on [FreeBSD Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/).

The [FreeBSD Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook) is good. It has almost information we need.

Thanks for it's authors.
