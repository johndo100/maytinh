When I'm with FreeBSD the first time.

I installed htop/bottom to monitor my computer.

But it was not show the cpu temperature.

I've used to check the temperature by this command `sysctl -a | grep temperature` when I needed it.

But it was not convenient.

Later I found that the cpu temperature even not correct.

The kernel did'nt read it from the sensor.

So I google it and know how to fix it.

It was easy by edit the boot loader config file.

```
# ee /boot/loader.conf
```

Add temp_load depends on which cpu Intel/AMD:

For Intel: `coretemp_load="YES"`

For AMD: `amdtemp_load="YES"`

Reboot and cpu temperature show up on htop/bottom.
