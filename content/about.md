## The one-man tech-team for technical assistance

I'm an IT consultant helping small business designing and implementing their technology solution.

I'm running my online business that I've build all of tech-need for it.

I can understand what small busineses want and the solution.

I was an account staff in a trading company so I know how the staffs run their computer.

I can communicate effectively with them who are low-tech-user and providing advice on best practices.

I'd like to build a solution that will be simple, easy-to-use with less-maintain.

It can be running for a long time and I don't need to touch it.

I have experience in software and hardware.

I've buid my mini-homelab, selfhosted my websites and my apps at my home.

### Some techs I used for my needs:

- OS: FreeBSD, Linux, Windows
- Programming language: Python, Golang, HTML, JS
- Database: SQL, Excel
- Framwework: Hugo
- Tool: Jail, Docker, Git

### Contact me if you think I can help.

Email: tuanth.ify4g@simplelogin.com

I will be around Thu Duc, Saigon.

> I'm a hard-working and responsible person like the old way.
